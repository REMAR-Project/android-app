REMAR: Android Application
==========================

REMAR is a citizen science based nature conservation project that focusses on the sustainable fishing of Mangrove Crabs in Brazil. Brazilian fisherman use the REMAR Android App to provide data about crab sighting in order to gain a better understanding of the crab's breeding behaviour and it's intimate connection to the lunar phase and tides.
